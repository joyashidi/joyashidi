## Hi there 👋 I'm Joy!

[![Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/Welcome_to_my_GitHub_Profile-😊-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/joyashidi)

I’m a **Cybersecurity Analyst** specializing in **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)** and currently pursuing a degree in **Computer Science**. My work focuses on identifying, exploiting, and securing vulnerabilities across **network systems, web applications, and APIs** to create safer digital environments.

I also have experience in front-end web development and enjoy combining technical creativity with cybersecurity principles.

Here, you’ll find my projects, scripts, and insights that reflect my journey in ethical hacking and security automation.
Let’s connect and collaborate!
